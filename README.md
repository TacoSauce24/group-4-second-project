## Description

This project was made with express-handlebars, sequalize, node-fetch, mysql, brcrypt, Bulma, and express. This is an application that allows a user to login, or sign up, and will then click on their own dashboard. The user will be able to search for an animal they like, and information will populate about that animal. The user will be able to see, if there are available matches, comments other users have made about that animal. The user will also be able to save his or her comments as well.
